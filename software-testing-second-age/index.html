out that the world of JavaScript and Front End
software development may be on <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/js-third-age/">the cusp of Third
Age</a>, and I for one could not
be happier to jump on that band-wagon. But, alas, I’ve saddled myself with
several projects written in the technology that has defined this Second Age:
React. In my exploration of React and it’s ecosystem (and embarking on a few
projects that are perhaps too ambitious to do alone), I have found only one
thing truly befuddling about building modern JavaScript applications:
testing.</p><p>Near the beginning of this last month, I published an article about <a href="/building-testing-intuition/">how I
was going to spend the month writing shitty
tests</a>. And I’m happy to report that I have, in
fact, written many, many shitty tests. Have I written enough that I can now
write amazing tests? No, no I haven’t, and it may take me years before I
finally get to that point (perhaps this coming Third Age has an answer to my
strife).</p><p>I have, however, learned. In particular, the most informative experience I
have had this month was reading the excellent <em>The Art of Software Testing</em>,
the bible for the field of software testing that has still managed to endure
(with a handful of revisions) for nearly 40 years. <em>The Art of Software
Testing</em> brought back semi-forgotten memories of sitting through my software
engineering class in college and clarified many things I had always wondered
about <!-- -->—<!-- --> the biggest being perhaps how a good test is formulated. What follows
is a series of lessons I’ve learned over the last month, both from this book,
and from the escapades I’ve had thus far trying to write tests for the
front-end.</p><blockquote><p>Disclaimer: What follows are the opinionated ramblings of a some-what
educated software developer who is taking their first steps into this wild
world of front-end web development.</p></blockquote><h1>Testing Intuition Isn’t Total Gibberish</h1><p>I want to get this out of the way, since <a href="/building-testing-intuition/">the topic of the last article I
wrote on software testing</a> was the idea of
“testing intuition”. Looking back at that article, and perhaps to no one’s
surprise, it’s very clear I had no idea what I was talking about. Which aptly
describes the level of knowledge I had about testing at the time (and
probably still maintain).</p><p>Turns out, however, that the notion of “testing intuition” is not complete
gibberish. In the chapters discussing how one goes about formulating tests,
the authors of <em>The Art of Software Testing</em> do address something similar,
which they refer to as <em>error guessing</em>. Error guessing is described as the
process where:</p><blockquote><p>Given a particular program, <!-- -->[the tester will]<!-- --> surmise, <!-- -->—<!-- --> both by
intuition and experience <!-- -->—<!-- --> certain probable types of errors and then
write test cases to expose those errors.</p></blockquote><p>This practice is reasonably ill-advised, since it’s not backed by any kind of
rigid system or methodology like other kinds of test case creation. But, it
does help get to the most obvious (or maybe least obvious) test cases,
allowing you to spend more effort on discovering the less trivial test cases
that are needed for a piece of software.</p><h1>Software Testing Is For Humans Too</h1><p>What originally started my dive into testing on the front-end was an
application I was working on for <a href="https://github.com/JoeBobMiles/TableTop">collaboratively playing
D&amp;D</a> and other table-top
role-playing games online. This kind of application, which is very heavy in
the graphics department, is plain <em>hard</em> to test.</p><p>Take, for example, the Token component, which represents a character on the
game board. This component has a few simple requirements:</p><ol><li>Show a portrait of the character</li><li>Move with the user’s mouse cursor when the user clicks and drags the Token.</li></ol><p>As informal as these requirements are, they are accurate to the basic
functions of the component. And both of these are impossible to test via an
automated process. Why?</p><p>Take, for example, the first requirement: “Show a portrait of the character”.
This is a pretty bad requirement, since ‘show’ could mean a few things. A
better requirement, and one that is centered around what the user will care
about, is: “On the token, a user shall see a portrait of the character that
token represents”. And this is where the trouble begins: how do you verify
that your user can see the portrait with an automatic test runner? Sure,
there are shortcuts, like checking that the Token has an image element
embedded in it, and that the image element is pointing to the right image
file. But how do you know if the image element is visible? You need several
boundary tests to check that every possible configuration of the Token keeps
the image element visible.</p><p>But what if you added an offset to the image, or applied a shape mask over
the image to make it render in a way that was appealing? How do you verify
that the offset doesn’t send the image off the screen? How do you verify that
the shape mask doesn’t fully obscure the image? These are things that are
incredibly hard to test in an automated setup, usually requiring visual
regression testing that checks the visual appearance of a component. But most
influential people in the modern testing scene consider these tests fragile,
since visual regression testing requires pixel-by-pixel comparisons to a
prior snapshot of the token’s appearance.</p><p>Ergo, you will inevitably need a user to verify that the simple requirement
“Show a portrait of the character” is satisfied. And this shouldn’t be
surprising, since human testing is <em>the first</em> testing method that is talked
about in The <em>Art of Software Testing</em>. And I’d argue, it’s more valuable than
integration tests in the <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/unit-vs-integration-vs-e2e-tests">“trophy” of software
testing</a>,
simply because a human saying “something looks funny” can provide a lot more
information than a machine saying “something looks funny”.</p><h1>Confidence In The Details</h1><p>The thing that bugs me the most about the mantra <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details">“don’t test implementation
details”</a> that
seems to dominate the discussion of front-end software testing is that the
methodology idolizes the concept of <em>black-box testing</em>. For the unfamiliar,
black-box testing is the idea of testing a program by feeding data in and
then checking that the data that comes out is correct. While not inherently
problematic, <em>The Art of Software Testing</em> illustrates that this is a
terrible way to go about testing software, since it would require an
untenable number of black-box tests to fully confirm that the software
contains no or, at the least, very few bugs. (Not to mention there may be
some requirements that cannot be verified by checking outputs alone.)</p><p>There is another way to perform testing <!-- -->—<!-- --> the reverse of black-box
testing <!-- -->—<!-- --> known as <em>white-box testing</em>. This kind of testing validates
that the software meets requirements by using knowledge of the software’s
inner workings. In other words, white-box testing tests those vile
implementation details. <em>The Art of Software Testing</em> talks about these kinds
of tests as well, but gives them the same verdict as black-box testing: you
cannot reasonably use only white-box tests to validate that your software is
free of bugs.</p><p>The solution, <em>The Art of Software Testing</em> proposes, is a combination of
strategically designed black-box and white-box tests. By verifying that your
code yields outputs that satisfy the requirements, and internally functions
within the specifications, you can have an incredible amount of confidence in
the code you deliver with a reasonable, but by no means <em>small</em>, number of
tests. And it’s this methodology I stand by, for reasons I have observed over
the last month of writing shitty tests.</p><p>The primary reason I standby the “grey-box” testing method is because for
every code base there are two categories of users: end-users and developers.
Black-box testing is perfect for satisfying end-users, and some classes of
developers (those, for instance, who consume some data processing API), but
doesn’t work so well when the developers have to interact with your code
structure (i.e. a fellow teammate) and be confident that when they change
something, the code doesn’t suddenly break</p><aside>The lack of completeness to this argument irks me, but I do feel that it&#x27;s the right one to make.</aside><h1>Specifications are Gold</h1><p>From my journey in testing so far, the biggest pain I have suffered is
sitting down to write the tests for a component and not knowing what to start
with. Trying to hold to the principle of TDD, in these situations I had no
actual component to test, only tests to write to describe the component I
would build. But I almost always ended up staring at a blinking cursor,
suffering a case of analysis paralysis as my brain went into a small
existential crisis about what the hell I was actually trying to build.</p><p>And I’m sure that it’s no surprise to anyone that it’s hard to write tests
without knowing what the specification for the component is. Shooting from
the hip is a great way to watch a project fall apart because none of the
tests are testing things that really matter. Or worse, there’s no tests at
all. Unfortunately, writing specifications can send one down the rabbit hole
of requirements engineering and software architecture. A rabbit hole I’m all
too familiar with at this point and has led a few too many projects to rot.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>There’s a lot I have yet to figure out about this testing business with
modern, front-end web applications, but I think that this past month has been
a decent start towards learning a little bit more about the subject. My next
goal is to start playing with other tools for building front-ends, like Vue
and the shiny new framework Svelte (which I and so many other devs seem to
adore), and learning if testing with them are any different from testing with
React, or if it is fraught with all the same problems.</p><p>But for now, my key takeaways are:</p><ul><li>ABT: Always Be Testing. The more tests you write, the quicker and easier
it will be to recognize potential problem areas and write tests to cover
them.</li><li>Don’t forget the humans. Automated tests are great, but there are some
things computers still can’t help us test. In those cases, don’t be afraid
to invite a person to help you!</li><li>The devil’s in the details. Leaving implementation details untested is
asking for poor developer experience and software architecture.</li><li>Stop! And write yourself some specifications! Don’t build software you
intend to test without first knowing what it’s expected to do (and not do).</li></ul></article></main><footer class="Layout-module--footer--3HSw1"><p>© <!-- -->Joseph R Miles<!-- --> <!-- -->2021</p></footer></main></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/software-testing-second-age/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-e4957c11759bdfc149d9.js"],"app":["/app-c37f6acb825be0b72f88.js"],"component---src-pages-404-tsx":["/component---src-pages-404-tsx-38c52949a0455ae0411a.js"],"component---src-pages-index-tsx":["/component---src-pages-index-tsx-e7d3a5751261577ef522.js"],"component---src-templates-post-tsx":["/component---src-templates-post-tsx-1644dbd17f6dc2191751.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/polyfill-e4957c11759bdfc149d9.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/component---src-templates-post-tsx-1644dbd17f6dc2191751.js" async=""></script><script src="/6cd6cca8ba4313667c6c4c5ce47e54f0d8414cc1-6603ddcc3717052aa4c7.js" async=""></script><script src="/styles-e9d24b1846c7d6eb9685.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-c37f6acb825be0b72f88.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-dbb498007a7447f28d8e.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-8141a3128a8b7d67b757.js" async=""></script></body></html>
