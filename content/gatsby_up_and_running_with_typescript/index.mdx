title: "Getting Up And Running With TypeScript"

If you’re like me and are someone who is:
 - [ ] Just getting started with Gatsby,
 - [ ] Already familiar with TypeScript, and
 - [ ] Used a basic Gatsby Starter (like my `gatsby-starter-empty`) that came
    without TypeScript[^1]

You’ll probably be wondering how to get up and running with TypeScript so you
can enjoy all the benefits of typed JavaScript.

So how do you do it?

# How You Do It

It starts with plugins, which is a common theme in Gatsby. If you’ve read
and/or followed the Gatsby documentation, they use plugins for damn near
everything (which annoys me to no end). So, to get started with using
TypeScript in your Gatsby project, simply run the following commands:

```
$ npm install --save gatsby-plugin-typescript
$ npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom
```

Enable the TypeScript plugin we installed by adding
‘gatsby-plugin-typescript’ to your plugin list in gatsby-config.js, and
startup your development server:

```
$ npm run develop
```

If you did everything exactly as shown above, you shouldn’t get any build
errors, which is great! Now we have TypeScript compilation working for our
Gatsby project. All you have to do to start using TypeScript is change all
those pesky .js/.jsx files into .ts/.tsx and you should be off to the races!

> __NOTE:__ Don’t change the file endings on any of your Gatsby config files! If
> you do, then Gatsby will startup assuming it has no configuration, breaking
> the build! In the Gatsby documentation for working with TypeScript, they
> explicitly state that you should not change the Gatsby config file endings
> from .js to .ts, and it’s (usually) a good idea to heed the docs!


[^1]:
    If you’re smart, you could avoid this by installing the TypeScript Starter,
    `gatsby-starter-typescript`, which is a fork of the default Starter
    (`gatsby-starter-default`) that has been converted over to TypeScript. This
    tutorial assumes that, like me, you were too stubborn (or clueless) about
    starting with as little as possible to be this smart.
