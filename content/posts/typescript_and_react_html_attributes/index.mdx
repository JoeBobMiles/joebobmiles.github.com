title: "Using HTML Attributes as React Component Props in TypeScript"

The hardest thing in TypeScript is knowing what types to give things,
especially when using third-party libraries like React. My most recent
headache has been trying to find a decent way to capture common HTML
attributes, like `id` and `className`, without having to hard code them into
the component's bespoke props.

# The solution

The solution is actually quite simple - embarssingly simple - and yet quite
difficult to find if you don't quite know what you're looking for. Or you're
me and keep forgetting how you solved this problem the last time you
encountered it.

Turns out that React has a utility type for containing all the attributes
that can be passed to HTML elements: `HTMLAttributes`. This is a generic
type, which means it accepts a type parameter. In this case, the type
parameter is just a plain-old object that you can use to nest an extension into
`HTMLAttributes` (which is pretty handy).

Before `HTMLAttribtues`, I would have had to do this:

```ts
// We have to include children explicitly in our bespoke prop-type for the 
// <Wrapper/>
type OwnProps = {
    children?: React.ReactNode
}

const Wrapper = ({ children }: OwnProps) => <div>{children}</div>
```

After `HTMLAttributes`, we get to do this:

```ts
// We don't need a bespoke prop-type!
const Wrapper = ({ children }: React.HTMLAttributes<{}>) => (
    <div>{children}</div>
)
```

It's wonderful!
